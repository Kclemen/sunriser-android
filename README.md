Sunriser is an Android app that integrates with [Milight RGBW connected light bulbs](http://www.milight.com/milight-rgbw/) to gradually wake you up in the morning. It starts emitting an artificial sunrise 30 minutes before your scheduled alarm, causing your body to release hormones that will help you wake up easily, feeling refreshed and ready to start your day.

Research shows that the healthiest way to wake up is along with the sun rising and the world gradually becoming lighter:

> The gradual increase in light intensity tells your body the sun is coming up. As a result the pineal gland reduces the hormone melatonin that makes you sleepy and secretes the hormones cortisol and serotonin into your bloodstream. These play an essential role in waking you up.
